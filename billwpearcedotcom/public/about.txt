I am a real life creative director who can write production 

Here is my professional life, in bullet form:

- 20 years of experience in design, illustration, and front-end development (read: Photoshop 7, Illustrator 10, and Notepad++)
- Senior level titles in design, front-end development, and creative technology at Code and Theory, Amazon, Publicis, and Goldman Sachs while maintaining a freelance design and illustration practice
- Iâ€™ve done every project under the sun: the regular stuff (logos, websites, ads, merch), the big stuff (enterprise level applications, Amazon.com), the weird stuff (Arduino, Alexa)
- Steady hand: pushed code to the fourth most-visited website on the internet (done a few public speaking engagements too)
- Always optimizing: my job at GS was to optimize a design team through tooling and process
- Industries include advertising, fintech, design consulting, creative services, blah blah
